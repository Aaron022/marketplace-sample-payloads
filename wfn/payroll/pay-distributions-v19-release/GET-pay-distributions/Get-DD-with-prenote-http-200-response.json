In the event that my Employer and/or ADP deposit funds into my account to which I am not entitled, I authorize my Employer, either directly or through ADP, to return such funds by initiating appropriate debit entries and adjustments accordingly. I understand that my deposit may not be credited to my account until the end of the day on the applicable pay date. It is my responsibility to: 1) ensure my bank account and deposit information is correct and complete; 2) timely verify that all transactions are accurate; and 3) immediately notify my Employer of any errors.  This authorization will remain in effect until I have cancelled it in writing with my Employer and Bank."
